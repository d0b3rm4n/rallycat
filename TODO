# Rallycat TODO

* todo time
* set todo time
* set notes on a task (-n overwrite, -N to append)
* add update behavior for stories (maybe)
* add update behavior for defects (maybe)
* Slow as balls? Make nice wait messages
* Add man page
* Create .rallycatrc file on first run?
* Listing stories
  * Per iteration
  * Per project (project configured in rc or passed in?)
* AC-only story view
* consolidate spec styles

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

## Ideas

rallycat list -s <search phrase>    # do a contains lookup for an iteration

Keep a log of last (n) stories typed into `cat` so the default action for
  `rallycat cat` will list the last (n) stories for the user.

### Notes

* Unblock by setting a new state
* Don't allow setting a new state and blocking, -b blocks current state


## Stats

* Stories in progress
* Stories accepted
* Stories not accepted
* Total To-Do Hours

rally.vim -> Making User Stories from Vim

## Rallycat Futures

* current iteration (or iteration) output (just story numbers and titles)
